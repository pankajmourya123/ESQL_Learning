You can use ESQL in the following built-in nodes:

Compute node
Database node
DatabaseInput node
Filter node
Mapping node
Compute Node: When you need to perform data transformations or message manipulation (e.g., changing the structure, adding/removing fields, calculations).


2. Database Node: When interacting with a database to perform CRUD operations (Insert, Update, Delete).


3. DatabaseInput Node: When you need to fetch data from a database and use it in the flow.


4. Filter Node: When you need to conditionally filter messages (e.g., based on certain conditions).


5. Mapping Node: When you need to map data from one format to another (e.g., converting between XML structures or changing field names/values).


DEFALUT SCHEMA 
1)the default schema is an empty schema that is automatically created when you create a new application or library.
2)It does not have a specific name and is simply referred to as the "default" schema
3)When you create ESQL files without specifying a schema, they are placed in this default schema

NON-DEFALUT SCHEMA(User defined schema )
1) you explicitly create and name when organizing your ESQL files.
2)This allows for better organization and management of ESQL code, especially in shared libraries where multiple applications or projects may need to access the same ESQL files.
