You can use ESQL in the following built-in nodes:

Compute node
Database node
DatabaseInput node
Filter node
Mapping node
Compute Node: When you need to perform data transformations or message manipulation (e.g., changing the structure, adding/removing fields, calculations).


2. Database Node: When interacting with a database to perform CRUD operations (Insert, Update, Delete).


3. DatabaseInput Node: When you need to fetch data from a database and use it in the flow.


4. Filter Node: When you need to conditionally filter messages (e.g., based on certain conditions).


5. Mapping Node: When you need to map data from one format to another (e.g., converting between XML structures or changing field names/values).
